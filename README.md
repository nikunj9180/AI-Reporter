# AI-Reporter
This Python script uses AI to generate event reports with basic details.

# Overview:

This Python script is designed to create event reports for college clubs. The user inputs basic event information such as the date, time, participation numbers, and a one-line event description. The script then uses artificial intelligence (AI) to generate a comprehensive event report, which is saved in the same directory with the correct format.
The script is designed to be fast and efficient, taking only 25 seconds to generate a report in a Word file once the data is inputted. This makes it a useful tool for college clubs that need to generate reports quickly and efficiently.
The purpose of the script is to automate the process of creating event reports, which can be time-consuming and tedious. By using AI to generate the report, the script saves time and ensures consistency in the report format. This can be especially useful for college clubs that organize multiple events throughout the year and need to create detailed reports for each event.
The script uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the input data and generate a coherent report. The report includes details about the event such as the venue, attendees, activities, and outcomes. The report is saved in a format that is easy to read and share with others, making it a valuable tool for tracking and analyzing event data.
Overall, this Python script simplifies the process of creating event reports for college clubs, making it easier to organize and analyze event data quickly and efficiently.
